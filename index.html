                    <h3> The history of <span>Canada</span> is very interesting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Early Origins
Indigenous peoples arrived in Canada via a land bridge from Siberia around 30,000 years ago.

Colonization
Vikings briefly settled in Newfoundland around 1000 AD. In 1497, John Cabot, under the British Crown, claimed the land. French and British colonization followed, leading to conflicts, with Britain eventually gaining control.

Formation of Canada
Canada gradually gained independence from Britain in the 19th century. The British North America Act of 1867 united several provinces into the Dominion of Canada. Further expansion and new provinces joined by 1949.

Economic Development
Canada’s economy grew significantly in the early 20th century, boosted by WWII. Post-war, it became a major industrial power with strong social policies and a high standard of living.

Cultural and Political Dynamics
Quebec sought separation in the 1980s but remains part of Canada. Canada is known for its multiculturalism and welcoming immigration policies.

                <p>Want a picture-perfect setting? Moraine Lake is the place to be. Located in Banff National Park, it has turquoise blue water and is surrounded by huge, snow-capped mountains. Five square kilometers in size, it is formed by glacial waters, i.e. the melting of mountain glaciers. To enjoy the tour, you can walk along the shore, go kayaking or climb up to a nearby lookout point for a panoramic view.

                    <h3> The Location of <span>Canada</span> is Beatiful</h3>
                    <p>
                        Canada is a country located in North America.
It is the second largest country in the world behind Russia. It borders the United States to the south and northwest (Alaska) and the Atlantic Ocean to the north. The country is bathed by the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans.
It has a rugged terrain and climates that vary from temperate in the south to Arctic in the north. The Canadian population today is just over 37.7 million inhabitants, who are concentrated in the southern portions of the territory. "

                <h3>The accent</h3>
                <p>Canada was colonized by the English and French, hence the country's two official languages. Over time, the accent became more American than British, and with the French influence and the particularities of the place, Canadian English was born.

                    One of the most striking differences between Canadian English and British and American English is the 'Canadian rising', whereby the diphthongs of words like wife and about end up sounding like 'weef' and 'aboot'.
                    
                    If you're planning a visit to Canada, here are some words that might be useful:
                    
                    Loonie: This is how they refer to the one Canadian dollar coin.
                    
                    Serviette: With this word, which means napkin, you can see the French influence that Canada's English has.
                    
                    Poutine: French fries, cubes of cottage cheese and gravy. Simply delicious.
                    
                    Washroom: Last but not least, the public restroom.

                <p>They are a source of pride among Canadians and very famous throughout the country. Butter tarts are desserts with a sweet pastry made from flour, butter and sugar, similar to Brazilian tarts, but a little more sugary. The filling consists of butter, sugar, eggs and another ingredient of the customer's choice, which can be walnuts, pecans, raisins, blueberries, apples or pumpkin. They can be found in many cafés and in all supermarkets in Canada.

The syrup is widely used with pancakes at breakfast (American-style pancake breakfast), crepes, waffles, ice cream and other treats.

                <h3>The politic</h3>
                <p>Canada's politics are based on a constitutional monarchy, meaning there is a monarch alongside a constitution, enforced by the country's Prime Minister. Currently, Queen Elizabeth II is the monarch. Canada is part of the group of nations under British monarchy rule.

                    The high ranks of the Canadian government include the Prime Minister—Justin Trudeau since 2015—the Queen, and a Governor-General appointed by the royalty, who serves as the Queen's legal representative in Canada. In practice, the Queen is the head of state, with her duties carried out by the Governor-General.
                    
                    Although understanding Canada's political system might seem challenging at first, it becomes easier over time. The constitutional monarchy system is also applied in other parts of the world.
                    
                    In addition to having a Queen and a Prime Minister, Canadian laws are based on Common Law, which means justice is administered based on customs and precedent rather than written laws. The country has three branches of government, with some political positions filled through elections and others appointed by the Prime Minister and Queen Elizabeth II.
                    
                    Researching and studying the country further helps in understanding the specifics of Canada's political system.

                <h3>the three powers</h3>
                <p>Canada's government is composed of three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial.

                    **Legislative Power:**
                    The legislative power is vested in the Parliament, located on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario. It consists of the House of Commons, the Senate, and the Monarch, represented by the Governor-General. The House of Commons has 308 members elected for up to five years. The current Speaker is Geoff Regan from the Liberal Party, which holds 183 seats. The Conservative Party is the opposition with 97 seats, followed by the New Democratic Party with 44 seats, the Bloc Québécois with 10 seats, two independents, and one Green Party seat. The Senate has 105 seats, filled by appointments from the Prime Minister and symbolically approved by the Governor-General.
                    
                    **Executive Power:**
                    The executive power is held by the Prime Minister, who appoints ministers to the executive positions. Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state, represented by the Governor-General, but the Prime Minister holds more executive power.
                    
                    **Judicial Power:**
                    The judicial branch is responsible for administering justice independently of the Queen. The Supreme Court, equivalent to Brazil's Supreme Federal Court, has nine judges appointed by the Governor-General. The judiciary ensures justice is upheld and Common Law is practiced, playing a crucial role in the country.

                    <h3> <span>Canada's</span> traditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Canada, holidays like Christmas, Halloween, and Thanksgiving are celebrated with great enthusiasm and long preparations, preserving each event's traditions and symbols.

Christmas (December 25):
Canadians traditionally set up real pine Christmas trees and ensure they are recycled after the holiday. They illuminate cities, wear festive clothing, and prepare typical dishes like butter tarts (sugar, eggs, butter, and maple syrup tart).

Halloween (October 31):
Preparations start in autumn, with festive visits to pumpkin farms. On Halloween, children go trick-or-treating, and everyone wears costumes of witches, ghosts, and monsters. The zombie walk is a classic event, with people dressed as the undead.

Canada Day (July 1):
This day celebrates the unification of Canada with public events organized by the government, including concerts, parades, contests, and fireworks displays.

Remembrance Day (November 11):
Canadians honor the memory of those who died in the world wars with two minutes of silence.

                    <h3> <span>Canada</span> customs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here are some cultural norms and practices in Canada:

1. **Sneeze into Your Elbow:** Instead of covering their mouth with their hand, Canadians sneeze into their elbow to prevent spreading germs.

2. **No Shoes Indoors:** Canadians often remove their shoes before entering a home to keep it clean and free of germs.

3. **Unspoken Agreement:** When invited to a dinner, guests typically bring wine, while the host provides the food.

4. **Bilingual Montreal:** Montreal is bilingual, with both French and English commonly used. Shops greet customers with "Bonjour, Hi."

5. **Personal Space:** Canadians value personal space and prefer less physical contact. Handshakes are more common than hugs or kisses.

6. **Sincere Inquiries:** When asking "How are you?" Canadians expect a genuine response, not just a polite formality.

7. **Independent Children:** Children are often seen without constant supervision, reflecting early independence.

8. **Early Dinner:** Dinner is typically around 5-6 PM, and punctuality is important.

9. **Wrinkled Clothes:** It's normal for Canadians to wear wrinkled clothes without judgment.

10. **Scheduled Appointments:** Canadians value punctuality and prefer to schedule appointments for everything, always arriving on time.

                <h3>as aventuras de pi</h3>
                <p>Excerpt from the synopsis: In The Adventures of Pi, Yann Martel's award-winning novel, we are introduced to this captivating character who suddenly loses everything - his dreams, his family, a future - after his ship sinks. “And what does he get in return?” you might ask, barely containing yourself with curiosity. All he has left is a vast ocean, a boat and a crew of survivors made up of a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger, animals from the old zoo. Wild, ferocious and lethal animals, by the way.

As well as inspiring the series of the same name (The Handmaid's Tale, in the original) produced by the streaming channel Hulu, Atwood's futuristic fiction, set in a theocratic and totalitarian state in which women are the preferred victims of oppression, becoming the property of the government, and fundamentalism is strengthened as a political force, has gained oracle status for the US in the Trump era.</p>

                <h3>Meaning of the colors of the Canadian flag</h3>
                <p>The Canadian flag features two colors: red and white. These colors have been official since 1921, approved by King George V. Red represents England and white represents France, the two countries that colonized Canada.

                    The red stripes symbolize the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans that border the country, while the white represents Canada's territory between these oceans.

                <h3>Meaning of Canada's flag symbols</h3>
                <p>The red maple leaf is the only symbol on the Canadian flag. It represents the stylized, 11-pointed shape of the maple leaf, a typical species of Canadian flora. The reddish hue of the leaf is a reference to the autumn period, when maple leaves turn this color.

                <h3>Curiosities about the Canadian flag</h3>
                <p>The official size of the Canadian flag is 1 meter wide and 2 meters long.

                    For many years, Canada used flags similar to those of England and France, which were the European countries that colonized Canadian territory.
                    
                    Another interpretation of the red color on the Canadian flag is a reference to the St. George's Cross on the British flag.
